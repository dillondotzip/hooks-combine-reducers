\# Hooks Combine Reducers Building a complex React app using the \`useReducer\` hook can lead to long reducers. It's better to split reducers & states into seperate files. \`hooks-combine-reducers\` accepts multiple reducer files or states and combines them into a single object. ## How To Use Create an initial state: \`\`\` const initialState = { key: value }; \`\`\` Then create multiple reducer functions: \`\`\` const reducer1 = (state, action) => { switch (action.type) { case "ACTION": return default: return state; } }; const reducer2 = (state, action) => { switch (action.type) { case "ACTION": return default: return state; } }; \`\`\` And finally combine the reducers: \`\`\` const \[state, dispatch\] = React.useReducer( combineReducers({ keyName1: reducer1, keyName2: reducer2 }), initialState ); \`\`\` ## Combining State You may want to separate state into different objects for better organization. \`\`\` import { combineReducers, combineStates } from 'hooks-combine-reducers'; const state1 = { ... } const state2 = { ... } const reducer1 = (state, action) => { switch (action.type) { case "ACTION": return default: return state; } }; const reducer2 = (state, action) => { switch (action.type) { case "ACTION": return default: return state; } }; const \[state, dispatch\] = React.useReducer( combineReducers({ keyName1: reducer1, keyName2: reducer2 }), combineStates(\[state1, state2\]) ); \`\`\`
